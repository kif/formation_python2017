    "# **The N-body problem**\n",

    "In physics, the $N$-body problem consists of the computation of all pair interactions in a system consisting of $N$ particles. The two best-known cases are gravitational interactions, e.g. between the stars in a galaxy, and electrostatic interactions between atoms represented as point charges. The interactions can be described by a potential energy or by the forces acting on each particle, i.e. the derivatives of the potential energy with respect to the positions. The latter case is practically more relevant in simulation algorithms.\n",

    "In the following, we will be interested in simulating a galaxy consisting of many bodies (stars, dusts, planets, ...). These bodies are represented by their position, their velocity and their mass. We use Newton's second law which says that mass times acceleration is equal to the total force on each mass point. The forces are computed using Newton's law of universal gravitation:\n",

The idea is to divide the $n$ bodies recursively into groups according to spatial proximity, by storing them in a quad-tree (for a 2D problem) and to say that if a group of bodies is sufficiently far away from any other bodies, we can approximate its graviationnal effects by using its center of mass. The center of mass of a group of bodies is the average position of a body in that group, weighted by mass. This algorithm is of complexity $n \\log n$.\n",
